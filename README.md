# CS370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS
Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In Project 2, the code I wrote was within the main loop of the application. The code allowed for the agent to decide it's action strategy. (Exploration or Explotation)

* Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    * How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

    In genereral while problem solving you would start with a bypothesis, then either prove or disprove it. With CS most of this would be in the form of algrithms. 
   
    * What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    
  In regards to Ethical responsibilities to the end user or oginization,  I believe it would be in being transperant. This transperancy might include examining biases and publishing any source the data came from for training.
